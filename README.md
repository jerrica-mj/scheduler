# Interview Scheduler

## Project Description

The Interview Scheduler is a single page application (SPA) for booking and tracking student interviews. It uses built-in and custom React hooks to allow the user to add, edit, and delete appointments, while maintaining persistent data in the API using a PostgreSQL database. The project follows Test Driven Development practices, with components tested in isolation and end-to-end.
